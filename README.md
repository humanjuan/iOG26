iOG26 is a simple Android app designed to block unwanted phone calls automatically. It helps you maintain your peace by filtering out spam, unknown callers, and specific numbers you choose to block.

## Key Features

- **Block Unknown Callers:** Automatically block calls from any number that is not in your contact list.
- **Custom Blocklists:**
    - **Numbers:** Add specific phone numbers to a personal blocklist.
    - **Prefixes:** Block all calls that start with a certain country or area code (e.g., +1-800).
- **Call History:** See a detailed history of all the calls that have been blocked by the app, including how many times each number has tried to call.
- **Daily Digest:** Get a daily notification that summarizes all the blocked call activity from the day.
- **Customizable Settings:**
    - Choose whether or not blocked calls appear in your phone's call log.
    - Decide if you want to receive a silent notification when a call is blocked.
    - Set the time for your daily digest.

The app is built with modern Android technologies like Jetpack Compose for the user interface and Room for local data storage.
